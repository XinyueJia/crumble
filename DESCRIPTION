Description: A modern, unified estimation strategy for common mediation estimands 
  (natural effects, organic effects, interventional effects, and recanting twins) in
	combination with modified treatment policies. Estimation makes use of recent advancements 
	in “Riesz-learning” to estimate a set of required nuisance parameters with deep learning. 
	The result is the capability to estimate mediation effects with 
	binary, categorical, continuous, or multivariate exposures with high-dimensional 
	mediators and mediator-outcome confounders using machine learning.
